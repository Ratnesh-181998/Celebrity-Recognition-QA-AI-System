# 🚀 Launching: Celebrity Recognition & Q/A AI System (Multimodal Biometric Intelligence)

I am excited to share my latest project—a production-grade **Multimodal AI Application** that bridges the gap between **Computer Vision** and **Large Language Models** to provide real-time identity detection and contextual intelligence.

🔍 **The Core Concept:**
This system doesn't just "detect" a face; it "understands" the persona. By fusing **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for high-fidelity biometric embeddings with **Groq’s LLaMA-4 Vision**, the app enables users to instantly identify celebrities and ask complex, context-aware questions about them in natural language.

🛠️ **Engineering & Tech Stack:**
Built with a **Microservices Architecture**, focusing on scalability and low-latency inference:

*   **🧠 Visual Intelligence:** OpenCV (Haar Cascades) & Vision Transformers (ViT) for 128-d vector embedding extraction.
*   **🤖 Generative AI:** Groq API (LLaMA-4 Vision) for sub-second multimodal reasoning and Q/A.
*   **💻 Frontend:** Streamlit for a highly interactive, responsive UI.
*   **⚙️ DevOps & Cloud:** Only the best practices—Dockerized containers orchestrated on **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** with a robust **CircleCI** pipeline for automated CI/CD.

💡 **Key Features:**
✅ **Real-Time Detection:** Instant face localization and recognition.
✅ **Interactive Q/A:** "RatneshAI" chatbot that knows *who* is on screen and answers career/bio queries instantly.
✅ **Enterprise-Ready:** Fully containerized Docker pipeline with Artifact Registry integration.
